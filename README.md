Kinetic inductance Traveling-wave amplification through Three-wave mixing with amorphous Tungsten

Superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computers due to
their anharmonic oscillators, which can be fabricated and measured using wellestablished
protocols. However, one major challenge in creating a good quantum
computer is the readout signal, which is often weak and accompanied by a high
level of noise. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a Three-Wave Mixing
Kinetic Inductance Traveling-Wave Amplifier that utilizes the special characteristics
of tungsten silicide in a superconducting state.
Our amplifier operates in a three-wave mixing fashion, significantly reducing
the power of the microwave pump tone and associated parasitic heating compared
to conventional four-wave mixing amplifiers. This allows for improved efficiency
and performance. The amplifier utilizes tungsten silicide (WSi) as a waveguide
with Kinetic inductance traits and incorporates aluminum fingers for capacitance,
creating a 50Î© artificial transmission line with a controlled amplification bandwidth.
The use of WSi allows for a smaller amplifier area while still achieving a theoretically
predicted gain of 16dB across a 5GHz bandwidth.
In this thesis, we present a theoretical model and experimental characterization of
our Three-Wave Mixing Kinetic Inductance Traveling-Wave Amplifier. Our model,
based on , demonstrates the potential for this amplifier to improve readout
signals in quantum computers, addressing a major challenge in the field.
